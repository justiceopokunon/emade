# E-MADE: Electronic Waste → Community Empowerment

**E-MADE is a youth-led initiative that tackles the growing crisis of electronic waste by collecting, safely recycling, and repurposing discarded electronics. The project reduces toxic pollution from improper dumping and burning of e-waste while transforming valuable components into new products for community use. Through public education, hands-on innovation, and responsible recycling practices, E-MADE protects human health, creates green skills for young people, and promotes a circular economy where electronics are reused instead of wasted.**

## 🎯 The Problem

Electronic waste (e-waste) is the fastest-growing waste stream globally. In underserved communities, informal recycling practices expose workers and families to:
- **Toxic fumes** from burning circuit boards
- **Chemical contamination** of soil and water
- **Data privacy risks** from unwiped devices
- **Lost economic opportunity** from poor reuse pathways

**Our solution:** E-MADE democratizes access to safe, scalable e-waste management through community-led training, DIY guides, and peer networks.

## 📊 Real-World Impact

**18.4k+ neighbors trained** in safe handling and drop-off practices  
**3,120+ safe drop-offs guided** to verified recyclers  
**100 youth** learning e-waste safety, repair basics, and reuse ethics
